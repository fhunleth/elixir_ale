  Start and link the I2c GenServer.

  `devname` is the I2C bus name (e.g., "i2c-1")
  `address` is the device's 7-bit address on the I2C bus

  Note that `address` can be confusing when reading a datasheet
  since sometimes the datasheet mentions the 8-bit address. For an 8-bit
  address the least significant bit indicates whether the access is for a
  read or a write. Microcontrollers like those on Arduinos often use the 8-bit
  address. To convert an 8-bit address to a 7-bit one, divide the address by
  two.

  All calls to `read/2`, `write/2`, and `write_read/3` access the device
  specified by `address`. Some I2C devices can be switched into different
  modes where they respond to an alternate address. Rather than having to
  create a second `I2c` process, see `read_device/3` and related routines.
